# ratis

Goddess of protective fortification and boundaries. Her name means "of the
fortress". She is remembered today because the Britons set up shrines to her at
various places along the Roman fortification known as Hadrian's Wall which ran
the east-west length of northern England for the purpose of keeping raiding
Scottish warriors on their own side of the border. Ratis' most notable worship
sites sere near the towns of Birdoswald and Chesters.
